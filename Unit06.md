**Unit 6: Fungi** <span id="6"></span> 
*Mycology, or the study of fungi, focuses on a diverse set of eukaryotic
organisms that range from microscopic single-cells to large mushrooms.
Fungi include yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. They are  decomposers that
have chitin in their cell walls. Fungi range from harmless, tasty
mushrooms to fatally poisonous toxins. Humans have cultivated fungi not
only for food but also for pest control and bioremediation. Penicillin,
the first common antibiotic, was derived from the Penicillium mold. Even
today, many newly discovered antibiotics have ties to fungi. In this
unit, we will look at both those fungi commonly associated with disease
as well those that have been cultivated for specialized purposes.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe the general characteristics of fungi, including growth
    requirements and reproductive properties;
-   identify which fungi are pathogenic and the common infection site;
