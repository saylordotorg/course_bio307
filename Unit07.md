**Unit 7: Protozoa and Helminths** <span id="7"></span> 
*ProEukaryotes include Fungi, Algae, Protozoa, and Helminths. This unit
discusses protozoa and helminths, which are parasites. Parasites are, by
definition, organisms that benefit only at the expense of their living
hosts. Protozoa are usually single-celled organisms that have highly
complex life cycles. Helminths (also known as parasitic worms) live
inside their hosts, often in intestinal tracts, where they hijack their
host’s nutrient absorption pathway. An astounding number of people are
believed to be infected with helminths; most estimates claim that at
least 1 billion individuals have been affected!*
