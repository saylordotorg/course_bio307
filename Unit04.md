**4.2 Identifying Microorganisms**  
  



**4.2.1 Plating and Culturing**

**Reading**: Sigma-Aldrich's ["Media Preparation”](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/analytical-chromatography/microbiology/learning-center/theory/media-preparation.html) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this article. Note that upon visiting this site you may be prompted to enter your location, do so in order to access this article. This resource describes how media can be used to grow microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. Media is prepared using various agents that will either enhance or inhibit the growth of certain organisms. 

Reading this article should take approximately 30 minutes.

**4.2.2 Differential Staining**



  





**4.2.2.1 Gram Staining**





**Web Media**: Wisconsin Technical College's WISC-Online: Kristine Snow's ["Gram Stain Procedure”](http://www.wisc-online.com/Objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=MBY4808) (Flash)





Instructions: Read through these lecture slides for a demonstration of the gram staining procedure. There are a total of 18 slides in this presentation.





Reading these slides should take approximately 30 minutes.

**4.2.2.2 Acid Fast Staining**





**Web Media**: Wisconsin Technical College's WISC-Online: Kristine Snow's ["Acid-Fast Stain”](http://www.wisc-online.com/objects/ViewObject.aspx?ID=MBY4407) (Flash)





Instructions: Study this short demonstration of the acid-fast staining procedure. Make sure to click on the "next” button at the bottom of each slide to continue your reading. Acid-fast staining is used to differentiate between organisms like the acid-fast positive "Mycobacterium tuberculosis” and other acid-fast negative organisms. Complete the two short review activities to evaluate how much you have learned. Note that you will only be able to access the second activity after completing the first matching activity on the last slide of the presentation.





Studying these slides should take approximately 30 minutes.
