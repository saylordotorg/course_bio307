**Unit 8: Viruses** <span id="8"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to viruses. Viruses are in the grey zone
between life and inorganic matter. You have learned in [BIO301: Cell
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/) that the cell is the
smallest unit of life, because it can sustain all life functions
including reproduction on its own. Most viruses are smaller than cells.
They do not feed or reproduce on their own; instead, they highjack their
host’s metabolism when they multiply. All viruses are comprised of a
nucleic acid core surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses are all
categorized into seven groups based on the type of nucleic acid they
carry. Viruses, while tiny, have powerful effects on their hosts; they
can even cause cancer, birth defects, and death.*
