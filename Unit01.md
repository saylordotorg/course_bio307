**Unit 1: Microbes** <span id="1"></span> 
*Microbes are microscopic; thus, we cannot see them by the naked eye.
Antoni van Leeuwenhoek crafted the first microscope lenses that
magnified over 200 times, and he turned his lenses towards everything.
He saw blood cells, sperm, hatching ants, and every cellular microbe
groups that we know of today. About 150 years later, Louis Pasteur’s
meticulously designed swan-necked flask experiments were instrumental in
putting off the spontaneous generation hypothesis for microbes. Pasteur
showed that microbes arise from microbes, and they are not generated
spontaneously from non-living matter. Before any microbe has ever been
linked to a disease, the independent death rate analyses of Semmelweis
and Nightingale led to the introduction of procedures that we call
antiseptic today. Koch was the first to photograph a pathogen in
infected tissue; he also laid down guidelines on how to link a
microorganism to a disease. These guidelines are Koch’s postulates. Only
a few microbes cause disease; most microbes are harmless. Microbes are
present in all three domains of life: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota.*

     Instructions: Read this webpage. The origin of life has always been
    fascinating, and the discovery of microbes was also followed by a
    debate on their origins. Prominent scientists of the time performed
    experiments to prove or disprove the spontaneous generation of
    microbes from non-living matter. The debate was going on for about
    200 years, when finally Pasteur put off the spontaneous generation
    theory with a set of smartly designed and carefully performed
    experiments.

    charge in the clinics and increased 10-fold when he was removed. The
    web media below connects you to a graph that was generated based on
