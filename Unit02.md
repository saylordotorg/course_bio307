**2.1 Cellular Metabolism**

**  
**

**Reading**: John Kimball's ["Factors Affecting Enzyme Action”](http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/E/Enzymes.html#pHandTemp) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this webpage for a general overview of enzymes and enzyme activity.

Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.

**Reading**: Scitable: Concept: ["Cell Metabolism”](http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/cell-metabolism-14026182) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this webpage for a brief review of what you have learned in the [BIO101: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a) course.

Reading this webpage should take approximately 30 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.

**Assessment**: The University of Arizona: The Biology Project's ["Energy, Enzymes, and Catalysis Problem Set”](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/biochemistry/problem_sets/energy_enzymes_catalysis/Energy_Enzymes_catalysis.html) (HTML)

Instructions: Complete the following problem sets: "Features of Enzyme Catalyzed Reactions,” "An Energy Barrier Separating Reactions and Products in a Chemical Reaction,” "Enzyme Features,” and "Understanding Activation Energy.” These are multiple-choice assessments. Choosing an option will bring you to a page with an explanation. Read the explanation, if any, and then return to the multiple-choice assessment. 

Completing this assessment should take approximately 30 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the web page above.  
  

**2.2 Bacterial Metabolism**

**Reading**: National Center for Biotechnology Information's Bookshelf: University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston: Baron S. (ed.)'s Medical Microbiology. 4th edition: Peter Jurtsuk's ["Chapter 4 Bacterial Metabolism”](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7919/) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this webpage. Recall what you have learned about cellular metabolism in the BIO101: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular Biology course. Compare and contrast the general cellular metabolism to bacterial metabolism.

Reading this webpage should take approximately 3 hours.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.

**Assessment**: Saylor Academy's ["Aerobic Respiration”](http://www.saylor.org/content/bio307/assessments/BIO403_Unit_2_2_assessment.html) (HTML)

Instructions: Complete this one question assessment. If your answer is correct, then it is acknowledged with a short explanation. Be sure to read each explanation carefully. If you click on a wrong answer, then you will go to a tutorial page. Read this page carefully and then return to the assessment and attempt to complete it again.

Note that aerobic and anaerobic respiration has been observed within the Kingdom of Bacteria as well.

Completing this assessment should take approximately 15 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.  
  

**2.3 Archaea Metabolism**

**Reading**: National Center for Biotechnology: Proceedings of Japan Academy Series B Physical & Biological Sciences: T. Imanaka's ["Molecular Bases of Thermophily in Hyperthermophiles”](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3309922/?tool=pubmed) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this webpage as an example of characteristic archaeal metabolic adaptations. Note that thermophile species are present in all four Archaea taxa (Korarcheotes, Euryarcheotes, Crenarcheotes, and Nanoarcheotes). In general, Archaea shares characteristics both with Eukarya (e.g. the initiator tRNA and introns) and with Bacteria (e.g. 70S ribosomes), but Archaea have unique molecular features as well (e.g. cell wall structure and branched membrane lipid hydrocarbones).

Reading this webpage should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.  
  

**2.4 The Metabolism of Protists**

**Reading**: The Royal Society: Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society: Michael L. Ginger et al.'s ["The Evolution of Organellar Metabolism in Unicellular Eukaryotes”](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1541/693.full) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this webpage. Recall from your studies in [BIO102: Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and Ecology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio102/) that most eukaryotes are protists. Protista is a diverse domain, reflected by organellar diversity.

Reading this webpage should take approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.

Terms of Use: Please respect the copyright and terms of use displayed on the webpage above.  
  

**2.5 Fungal Metabolism**

**Reading**: National Center for Biotechnology Information's Bookshelf: University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston: Baron S. (ed.)'s Medical Microbiology, 4th edition: Garry T. Cole's ["Chapter 73 Basic Biology of Fungi”](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8099/) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this chapter. In [BIO102: Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and Ecology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio102/), you learned that fungi are decomposers. Compare and contrast the general cellular metabolism to fungal metabolism.

Reading this chapter should take approximately 1 hour.
