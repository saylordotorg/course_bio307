**Unit 2: Microbial Metabolism** <span id="2"></span> 
*Cellular metabolism is the collection of all chemical reaction that
takes place in the cell. You have already studied cellular metabolism in
the [BIO101: Introduction to Molecular and Cellular
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a) and  [BIO301: Cell
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/) courses. Take some time
to review the cellular metabolism units in these courses before you dive
into this unit. In this unit, you will study specifics of microbial
metabolism; the most detailed subunit belongs to bacteria. The
metabolism in all domains is very divergent; Archaea and Protista are
the most divergent. We know most about pathogenic bacteria, because they
have medical significance.*

Completing this unit should take you approximately 8.75 hours.
