**Unit 10: Applied Microbiology** <span id="10"></span> 

*In this last unit, we will learn about other major sub-fields of
microbiology, including environmental microbiology, biotechnology, and
microbial food preparation. We briefly touched upon these topics in our
introduction, but we will now go through them in more detail. We will
also consider some of the many applications of microbiology. Note that
bacteria and fungi (yeast) are used to make vitamins, antibiotics, and
beer and to clean up petroleum.*
