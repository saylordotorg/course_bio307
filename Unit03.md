**Unit 3: Bacterial Growth, Reproduction, and Genetics** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This course focuses on bacteria, the most studied type of
microorganism. We will begin this unit by learning how bacteria cells
obtain their energy and how they grow. Metabolism varies greatly among
bacteria; not all share the same kinds of mechanisms. While most require
oxygen to survive, for example, some will actually die in the presence
of oxygen. As the microbiology field increasingly involves the
artificial cultivation of bacteria, it is important to know the methods
and concepts behind their growth and cultures as well.  
  
 Bacteria divide and multiply at amazing rates. Under the right
conditions, the fastest bacteria can divide every 20 minutes! That means
that if you cultured just one single bacteria cell before you went to
bed, you could wake up 8 hours later with a plate of more than 16
million bacteria! Much of bacterial reproduction is asexual, occurring
through binary fission. In binary fission, one cell literally divides in
two. We will conclude this unit by learning about horizontal gene
transfer, a process by which one bacteria cell incorporates genetic
changes from another cell without being its offspring. This unique
feature has allowed bacteria to adapt and grow in conditions it would
not otherwise be able survive. It has also led to the increase of
drug-resistant bacterial infections.*
