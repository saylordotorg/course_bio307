**Unit 5: Bacteria and Human Disease** <span id="5"></span> 
*Ever since Louis Pasteur first theorized that microorganisms were the
source of infectious diseases, scientists have labored to learn more
about the causes of disease and, more generally, the field of
microbiology as a whole. As a result, the majority of microbiology
research has focused on human disease and immunology (the study of the
immune system). The following unit will discuss microorganisms and the
diseases that they cause.   
  
 We will begin with bacteria, learning that they are mainly classified
as cocci, bacilli, or spiral shaped. They are also differentiated via
gram staining procedures, which indicate the amount of peptidoglycan
present in a cell wall. If a bacterium contains a lot of peptidoglycan
in its cell wall, it will take up the primary gram stain (crystal
violet) and will appear purple (gram positive). However, if the
bacterium contains a small amount of peptidoglycan and an outer
membrane, it will not take up the primary stain. It will instead take up
the secondary stain (safranin) and will appear red (gram negative). Each
of the classes listed below has been selected for its importance to
modern microbiology; take the time to learn all of their names!*

     Instructions: Read the sections “Escherichia coli,” “Shigella,”
    “Salmonella,” and “Yersinia.” Some of these names might be familiar
    to you. For example, you might have heard of Escherichia before; it
    is the “E” in E. coli, one of the most commonly studied organisms in
    microbiology. Meanwhile, Salmonella is most commonly found on
    uncooked meats and raw vegetables and is one of the most common
    agents of food poisoning. Salmonella has nothing to do with the
    fish, salmon; it was named after Dr. Daniel Salmon, the first
    individual to hold a doctorate in veterinary medicine in America.
    Lastly, Yersinia is the cause of the bubonic plague, one of the
    deadliest diseases in human history. Also known as the “Black
    Death,” it wiped out entire cities and killed hundreds of millions
    of people. It was so devastating that the total population of Europe
    was not able to recoup its numbers until more than a century later,
    permanently altering the course of European history.
