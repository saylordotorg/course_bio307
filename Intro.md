Course Syllabus for "BIO307: Microbiology"
------------------------------------------

Even in ancient times, scholars believed that diseases could be spread
by organisms too small to be seen by the naked eye. Before we discovered
that bacteria cells were the real culprits, many attributed disease to
other sources. Now that scientists have definitively identified the
microscopic causes of various infectious diseases, microbiology, or the
study of microscopic-sized organisms, has become an increasingly
important field in biology and in the larger biomedical community. Most
microbes are harmless. Some of them are essential for life on Earth,
e.g. through their ability to fix nitrogen. Biotechnology, which is
truly the industry of our times, takes advantage of microbes for the
production of a variety of complex substances, and it also mass-produces
natural and engineered microbes for human use. This course will cover a
range of diverse areas of microbiology, including virology,
bacteriology, and applied microbiology. This course will focus on the
medical aspects of microbiology, as medical research has been the
primary motivator in microbiology research. This course pairs well with
[BIO407: Immunology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio407/), which
studies the body’s defenses against foreign invaders in great detail.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to:

-   explain what microbes are, and recognize microbes on micrographs;
-   compare and contrast cells, viruses, and microbes of the three
    domains of life;
-   discuss pathogenic microbes and their epidemiology, and employ
    Koch's postulates;
-   compare and contrast pathogenic protists and bacteria;
-   explain how opportunistic pathogens case illness;
-   describe the life cycle of protists and helminths that are human
    pathogens;
-   discuss different mechanisms of viral infections;
-   recognize microorganisms based on their shape, size, arrangement,
    staining, and culture characteristics;
-   design ways to control microbial growth;
-   discuss cellular metabolism in prokaryotes and eukaryotes;
-   outline antimicrobial methods including antibiotic use;
-   compare and contrast genetics and methods of reproduction in various
    microorganisms;
-   explain how the human body protects itself and how vaccines protect
    the body;
-   compare and contrast innate and adaptive immunity; and
-   discuss uses for microbiology in the food industry and in
    bioremediation.

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course, you must:  
  
 √    have access to a computer;  
  
 √    have continuous broadband Internet access;  
  
 √    have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.
Adobe Reader or Flash);  
  
 √    have the ability to download and save files and documents to a
computer;  
  
 √    have the ability to open Microsoft files and documents (.doc,
.ppt, .xls, etc.);  
  
 √    be competent in the English language; and  
  
 √    have completed the following courses: [BIO101: Introduction to
Molecular and Cellular Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio101a/),
[BIO102: Introduction to Evolutionary Biology and
Ecology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio102/), and [BIO301: Cell
Biology](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/). 

### Course Information

Welcome to BIO307: Microbiology! General information on the course and
its requirements can be found below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** Amy L. Thompson, PhD, MLS (ASCP)  
  
 **Primary Resources:** This course is comprised of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   University of South Carolina’s School of Medicine: [Microbiology and
    Immunology Online](http://pathmicro.med.sc.edu/book/welcome.htm)
-   Dr. Kenneth Todar’s *[Online Textbook of
    Bacteriology](http://www.textbookofbacteriology.net/)*
-   Dr. Gary E. Kaiser’s [BIOL 230 Microbiology Lab
    Manual](http://faculty.ccbcmd.edu/courses/bio141/labmanua/toc.html)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 1 and 2 as these lay the groundwork for
understanding the more exploratory material presented in the latter
units. You will also need to complete the following:  

-   Subunit 1.1.1: Assessment
-   Subunit 1.2: Activity
-   Subunit 1.6.2: Assessment
-   Subunit 2.1: Assessment
-   Subunit 2.2: Assessment
-   Subunit 3.1: Assessment
-   Subunit 3.3: Assessment
-   Subunit 3.3.5: Assessment
-   Subunit 3.4: Questions
-   Subunit 4.2.2.2: 2 Quizzes
-   Subunit 5.6: Assessment
-   Subunit 6.5.2: Assessment
-   Subunit 9.2: Assessment
-   The Final Exam

Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the quizzes and activities listed above.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score will be tabulated as soon as you complete
it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
  
 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total of
**128 hours**. Each unit contains a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time that you are expected to spend on each subunit. These
should help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and determine how much time you have over
the next few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for
yourself. Use the time advisories to help you plot out your schedule of
when you do each unit/subunit and on which days of the week. For
example, Unit 1 will take 15.75 hours total. You may consider completing
subunit 1.1.1 (a total of 2.5 hours) on Monday; subunit 1.1.2 (about
1.75 hours) on Tuesday; and subunit 1.2 (about 2 hours) on Wednesday;
etc.
