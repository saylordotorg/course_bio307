**Unit 9: Defense Against Microbes** <span id="9"></span> 
*This unit will discuss the major defenses we have against
disease-causing microbes. With all of the microorganisms that threaten
to infect and harm an individual, our bodies have evolved sophisticated
defenses against these foreign invaders. However, our immune systems can
still be overwhelmed; we often need the help of medication to win the
battle. In this unit, we will learn about the primary human defenses
against disease before discussing the generalized agents that we use
outside of the human body to combat different types of microbes.*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
Completing this unit should take you approximately 7.25 hours.  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.1: 3 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 3.25 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 2 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   differentiate between non-specific and specific immunity;
-   describe how vaccinations are used to control infection; and
-   explain how antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics, and antifungals
    work to prevent microbial growth and infection.

     Instructions: Read this chapter, which describes how the body
    combats the invasion of microorganisms in a non-specific manner.
    Non-specific mechanisms include skin and mucous membranes, as well
    as the innate immune response. Take advantage of the PowerPoint
    lecture slides as you study. To download the PowerPoint lecture
    slides, click on the P icon below the “Video Lecture” heading on the
    top left panel. Click on the icons of Figures 1 to 3 and 9 to 14 for
    summaries and mechanisms.
