**9.1 Non-Specific Immunity (Skin and Mucous Membrane and Innate Immunity)**

**Reading**: University of South Carolina School of Medicine Dr. Gene Mayer's ["Innate (Non-Specific) Immunity”](http://www.microbiologybook.org/ghaffar/innate.htm) (HTML)

Instructions: Read this chapter, which describes how the body combats the invasion of microorganisms in a non-specific manner. Non-specific mechanisms include skin and mucous membranes, as well as the innate immune response. Take advantage of the PowerPoint lecture slides as you study. To download the PowerPoint lecture slides, click on the P icon below the "Video Lecture” heading on the top left panel. Click on the icons of Figures 1 to 3 and 9 to 14 for summaries and mechanisms.

Studying this resource should take approximately 3 hours.
